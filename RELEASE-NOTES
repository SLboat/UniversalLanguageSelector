== UniversalLanguageSelector 2013.07 ==
Released at 2013-07-31.

===Noteworthy changes===
Languages code aliases are now used properly in the Common languages section. This allows, for example, proper display of Tagalog for users from the Philippines.

The variable $wgULSNoImeSelectors was added to allow disabling IME on elements by specifying jQuery selectors that match them.

Basic preparation for using MediaWiki's EventLogging framework was done. It is only enabled if the EventLogging extension is installed and a schema is configured.

The functions for web fonts loading were optimized to improve performance.

The CSS class 'uls-settings-trigger' can be added to any element so that clicking it will make the ULS appear. It is useful for documentation and examples.

Web fonts are applied to the IME selector menu, too.

The internals of loading translated message were changed from the original jquery.i18n implementation to allow loading messages from other domains (CORS).

===Input methods===
LRM and RLM were added to the Hebrew input methods and the redundant he-kbd input method was removed.

Danda was removed from the Marathi phonetic input method.

A bugs was fixed in Kannada, Tamil and Marathi input methods that didn't allow typing some characters.

The Slovak input method was fixed according to the standard Slovak keyboard.

The names of the Oriya input methods were updated.

===Fonts===
