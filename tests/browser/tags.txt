  Test is run on this domain unless further excluded by other tags.

@language
  This tests needs support from Accept-Language header setting from the
  webdriver.

@login
  This test logs in. You can filter these tests out if you don't have an
  account available.

@reset-preferences-after

  could use your normal user account if you skip these tests, but I would not
  recommend doing that.

@uls-in-personal-only
@uls-in-sidebar-only
  These tests will automatically be marked as skipped if ULS configuration is
  not the one expected for the test.

@anon-language-selection
@no-anon-language-selection
  Depending on the wiki configuration, you should filter out either one of
  these tests.
